# Task
Build a machine learning system as a solution to a practical challenge:
The focus is on aligning your understanding of machine learning systems with practical
applications. “Alignment” and “Practicality” are the two essential factors in this type of
projects. To fulfil this project type, you must design a learning-based system to tackle
a problem involving real-world data. This task can be anything from predicting stock
prices to identifying patterns in images or text. You should formulate the task into a
computable form and ensure the learning objective (loss) is both computationally
effective and practically relevant.
